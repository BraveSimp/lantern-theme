```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&display=swap');
:not(i[class*="fa"]):not(.stfs-icon):not(.stf-icon) {
    font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace !important;
    letter-spacing: -0.30px !important;
}
```
Soon, you'll also be able to change the whole theme with only a few lines of code and customize it however you want.
