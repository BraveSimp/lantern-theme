### Custom CSS
Download Custom CSS and place it into your Vivaldi ``/style`` folder, going to ``vivaldi://experiments`` then turning on "Allow for using CSS modifications", then go to Settings → Appearance → Custom UI Modifications and choose your folder, lastly - Restart! If you're facing any troubles follow the official guide https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/guide-modding-vivaldi.

You should also install Fira Code (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) or change the ``font-family`` in the css file to another font.
